## 📖 About The Game

**Last Sacrifice** is my first game developed in Unity - a thrilling 2D strategy defense game where every decision matters. You must protect a sacred altar from relentless enemy waves through careful resource management and strategic sacrifices.

> *"Defend the sacred. Sacrifice the few. Save the many."*

### 🎯 Core Objective
Protect the central altar by gathering resources, setting strategic traps, and making the ultimate sacrifice - offer 25 workers to achieve victory and secure your realm's future.
